# Defining your components

For the editor to work you have to define the components you want to use on your page. Each component can be registered using the `registerComponent()` method

```js
// Register a component / block
editor.registerComponent('<COMPONENT_IDENTIFIER>', {
  category: '<CATEGORY_LABEL>',
  title: '<COMPONENT_TITLE>',
  fields: [/* An array of fields */]
})
```

The fields property is an array of field definition

You can use the built in fields (explained in the next chapter of this documentation) or [create your own](./Fields/CustomField.md).
